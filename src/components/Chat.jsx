                Protego Health AI Clinical Decision Support Platform Terms of Use

                Purpose and Functionality
                The Protego Health AI Clinical Decision Support (CDS) platform is specifically designed to augment the clinical decision-making processes of healthcare professionals. The platform's functionalities include the generation of preliminary drafts for differential diagnoses, clinical assessments, treatment plans, and responses to clinical reference inquiries.

                Recommendation and Review
                All outputs generated by the AI CDS serve as preliminary recommendations intended for independent review by the clinician user. These outputs are to be utilized as draft recommendations, requiring detailed review and validation by the clinician. The AI CDS platform's core features are intended solely as a supplementary tool to support clinical reasoning and must not replace or override the professional judgment of clinicians.

                Platform Development and Limitations
                Protego Health is committed to the continuous development of the AI CDS platform while recognizing and addressing its current limitations. The mission is to empower clinicians with a leading-edge AI CDS platform and improve patient outcomes globally.

                Bias and Equity Considerations
                Large language models, such as those utilized in the AI CDS platform, inherently possess limitations, including the potential to perpetuate biases derived from pre-training, fine-tuning, and user input. Protego Health has made extensive efforts to mitigate the perpetuation of harmful biases. As part of our commitment to safety, equity, and alignment in the deployment of AI CDS globally, users are advised to omit elements of clinical scenarios related to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, socio-economic status, disabilities, age, geographical location, and language or cultural background when utilizing the AI CDS. The prevention of bias perpetuation and the promotion of health equity are fundamental components of Protego Health's mission.

                Restrictions on Use
                The Protego Health AI CDS platform is explicitly not intended for use by patients. Users are strictly prohibited from employing this platform for personal health advice or as a substitute for professional medical consultation. The platform provides recommendations intended to assist clinicians in their clinical decision-making processes. AI-generated responses necessitate the expertise of a qualified clinician for accurate interpretation, as they often encompass a broad spectrum of potential diagnoses, diagnostic options, and therapeutic considerations within the context of probabilistic clinical reasoning.
